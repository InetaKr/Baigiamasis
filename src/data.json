      "answer": "It is always best to consult with your vet regarding any specific pet medication question; that being said, there are some general guidelines you can follow regarding these three types of common treatments.\n\nHeartworm medication should be provided for pets on a consistent basis by the time they reach the age of six months. This is especially relevant for areas of the globe, like North America, where mosquitoes, the carriers of heartworm, are relatively prevalent.\nFlea medication can be applied as a preventative or on an as-needed basis, i.e., when infestation occurs! There are various types of flea medication including pills and ointment. Some work better than others, so talk to your vet!\nMuch of the time, medications on the market combat both ticks and fleas at the same time. So when should you invest in these types of pills? Some people try to be proactive in fighting off these pests since ticks especially can be very harmful for our pets if they pounce. During the months of summer and spring, the likelihood of infestation is at it’s highest, but that doesn’t mean the bugs won’t show up when the weather gets cold! A breakdown of this winter tick and flea reality can be found here in an article by PetMD. Though fleas and ticks are less prevalent at certain times to be sure; during winter, medication is still a good idea.",
